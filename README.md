Некоторые из нас живут в России. У некоторых бабушки и дедушки сражались с фашистами во Второй мировой войне. Здесь никто не поддерживает фашизм.

> У одного из нас есть украинская родственница, которая спаслась из дома вместе с сыном. Поезд задержался из-за бомбежки на дороге впереди. У нас есть друзья, которые прячутся в бомбоубежищах. Мы с тревогой ждем весточки от них после воздушных налетов, которые беспорядочно наносят удары и попадают по больницам, школам, детским садам и домам. Мы не берем это из каких-либо СМИ. Мы наблюдаем это напрямую.

## Introduction

This is a skeleton application using the Laminas MVC layer and module
systems. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those
looking to get their feet wet with Laminas MVC.

## Installation using Composer

The easiest way to create a new Laminas MVC project is to use
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). If you don't have it already installed,
then please install as per the [documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

To create your new Laminas MVC project:

```bash
$ composer create-project -sdev laminas/laminas-mvc-skeleton path/to/install
```

Once installed, you can test it out immediately using PHP's built-in web server:

```bash
$ cd path/to/install
$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public
# OR use the composer alias:
$ composer serve
```

This will start the cli-server on port 8080, and bind it to all network
interfaces. You can then visit the site at http://localhost:8080/

- which will bring up Laminas MVC Skeleton welcome page.

**Note:** The built-in CLI server is _for development only_.

## Development mode

The skeleton ships with [laminas-development-mode](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-development-mode)
by default, and provides three aliases for consuming the script it ships with:

```bash
$ composer development-enable  # enable development mode
$ composer development-disable # disable development mode
$ composer development-status  # whether or not development mode is enabled
```

You may provide development-only modules and bootstrap-level configuration in
`config/development.config.php.dist`, and development-only application
configuration in `config/autoload/development.local.php.dist`. Enabling
development mode will copy these files to versions removing the `.dist` suffix,
while disabling development mode will remove those copies.

Development mode is automatically enabled as part of the skeleton installation process.
After making changes to one of the above-mentioned `.dist` configuration files you will
either need to disable then enable development mode for the changes to take effect,
or manually make matching updates to the `.dist`-less copies of those files.

## Running Unit Tests

To run the supplied skeleton unit tests, you need to do one of the following:

- During initial project creation, select to install the MVC testing support.
- After initial project creation, install [laminas-test](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-test/):

  ```bash
  $ composer require --dev laminas/laminas-test
  ```

Once testing support is present, you can run the tests using:

```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

If you need to make local modifications for the PHPUnit test setup, copy
`phpunit.xml.dist` to `phpunit.xml` and edit the new file; the latter has
precedence over the former when running tests, and is ignored by version
control. (If you want to make the modifications permanent, edit the
`phpunit.xml.dist` file.)

## Running Psalm Static Analysis

To run the supplied skeleton static analysis, you need to do one of the following:
It is recommended to install the test components from laminas (laminas/laminas-test),
as this is used in the tests supplied.

```bash
$ composer require --dev vimeo/psalm psalm/plugin-phpunit laminas/laminas-test
```

Once psalm support is present, you can run the static analysis using:

```bash
$ composer static-analysis
```

## Using Vagrant

This skeleton includes a `Vagrantfile` based on ubuntu 18.04 (bento box)
with configured Apache2 and PHP 7.3. Start it up using:

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

Once built, you can also run composer within the box. For example, the following
will install dependencies:

```bash
$ vagrant ssh -c 'composer install'
```

While this will update them:

```bash
$ vagrant ssh -c 'composer update'
```

While running, Vagrant maps your host port 8080 to port 80 on the virtual
machine; you can visit the site at http://localhost:8080/

> ### Vagrant and VirtualBox
>
> The vagrant image is based on bento/ubuntu-18.04. If you are using VirtualBox as
> a provider, you will need:
>
> - Vagrant 2.2.6 or later
> - VirtualBox 6.0.14 or later

For vagrant documentation, please refer to [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

## Using docker-compose

This skeleton provides a `docker-compose.yml` for use with
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/); it
uses the provided `Dockerfile` to build a docker image
for the `laminas` container created with `docker-compose`.

Build and start the image and container using:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

At this point, you can visit http://localhost:8080 to see the site running.

You can also run commands such as `composer` in the container. The container
environment is named "laminas" so you will pass that value to
`docker-compose run`:

```bash
$ docker-compose run laminas composer install
```

Some composer packages optionally use additional PHP extensions.  
The Dockerfile contains several commented-out commands
which enable some of the more popular php extensions.
For example, to install `pdo-pgsql` support for `laminas/laminas-db`
uncomment the lines:

```sh
# RUN apt-get install --yes libpq-dev \
#     && docker-php-ext-install pdo_pgsql
```

then re-run the `docker-compose up -d --build` line as above.

> You may also want to combine the various `apt-get` and `docker-php-ext-*`
> statements later to reduce the number of layers created by your image.

## Web server setup

### Apache setup

To setup apache, setup a virtual host to point to the public/ directory of the
project and you should be ready to go! It should look something like below:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName laminasapp.localhost
    DocumentRoot /path/to/laminasapp/public
    <Directory /path/to/laminasapp/public>
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
        Require all granted
        </IfModule>
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

### Nginx setup

To setup nginx, open your `/path/to/nginx/nginx.conf` and add an
[include directive](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#include) below
into `http` block if it does not already exist:

```nginx
http {
    # ...
    include sites-enabled/*.conf;
}
```

Create a virtual host configuration file for your project under `/path/to/nginx/sites-enabled/laminasapp.localhost.conf`
it should look something like below:

```nginx
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  laminasapp.localhost;
    root         /path/to/laminasapp/public;

    location / {
        index index.php;
        try_files $uri $uri/ @php;
    }

    location @php {
        # Pass the PHP requests to FastCGI server (php-fpm) on 127.0.0.1:9000
        fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME /path/to/laminasapp/public/index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

Restart the nginx, now you should be ready to go!

## QA Tools

The skeleton does not come with any QA tooling by default, but does ship with
configuration for each of:

- [phpcs](https://github.com/squizlabs/php_codesniffer)
- [laminas-test](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-test/)
- [phpunit](https://phpunit.de)

Additionally, it comes with some basic tests for the shipped
`Application\Controller\IndexController`.

If you want to add these QA tools, execute the following:

```bash
$ composer require --dev squizlabs/php_codesniffer laminas/laminas-test
```

We provide aliases for each of these tools in the Composer configuration:

```bash
# Run CS checks:
$ composer cs-check
# Fix CS errors:
$ composer cs-fix
# Run PHPUnit tests:
$ composer test
```
